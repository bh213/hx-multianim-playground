# Save Functionality Test

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Ctrl+S Not Working
- **Problem**: Monaco editor save action was not properly registered or had conflicts
- **Solution**: 
  - Simplified Monaco editor action registration
  - Added stable save handler reference using `React.useCallback`
  - Added multiple fallback mechanisms (Monaco action, global event listener, App-level handler)
  - Used refs to ensure save handler is accessible in event listeners

### 2. Apply Changes Works on Second Try
- **Problem**: File selection logic was unreliable, causing first save attempt to fail
- **Solution**:
  - Improved `ensureFileSelected()` function with better fallback logic
  - Added auto-retry mechanism when no file is selected
  - Enhanced file selection validation
  - Added timing delay for retry attempts

## Key Changes Made

### CodeEditor.tsx
- Simplified Monaco editor save action registration
- Added `saveHandlerRef` to store save handler reference
- Removed complex keybinding service approach
- Kept global event listener as fallback

### App.tsx
- Added stable `saveHandler` using `React.useCallback`
- Improved `ensureFileSelected()` function with multiple fallback strategies
- Added App-level global keyboard shortcut handler
- Enhanced `handleApplyChanges()` with auto-retry logic
- Updated all save triggers to use stable handler reference

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the application at http://localhost:3000
2. Select a screen (e.g., "Particles")
3. Make changes to the manim file content in the editor
4. Try Ctrl+S - should save and reload on first try
5. Try clicking "Apply Changes" button - should work on first try
6. Verify that unsaved changes indicator appears and disappears correctly

## Expected Behavior

- Ctrl+S should work immediately when editor is focused
- "Apply Changes" button should work on first click
- File should be automatically selected if none is selected
- Changes should be saved and playground should reload
- Unsaved changes indicator should update correctly
